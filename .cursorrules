# Project

This is a project to index my discogs collection, placing the data into the `website` directory, which is a static website built with Hugo. It uses a SQLite database to cache the data to avoid rate limiting and to speed up the processing.

- The project uses the discogs API to get the data.
- The project uses the wikipedia API to get the data.
- The project uses the apple music API to get the data.
- The project uses the spotify API to get the data.

# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output:
  - Use logging levels appropriately (INFO for main operations, DEBUG for details, WARNING for expected issues, ERROR for problems)
  - Log all API interactions with request details and responses
  - Include timing information in log format
  - Store logs in dated files under logs/ directory
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Integration & Data Handling:**
   - Verify API tokens upfront and isolate API data structures for Discogs, Apple Music, Wikipedia, and Spotify.
   - Implement robust error handling and detailed logging for all API interactions.
   - Maintain validation of required fields in cached API responses.

2. **Progress Tracking & Data Structure:**
   - Migrate progress tracking from a file-based system to a database-based method using a `processed_index` table for improved reliability.
   - Ensure consistent and well-documented data structures when caching API responses.

3. **Debugging & Logging:**
   - Use appropriate logging levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR) for comprehensive diagnostic details.
   - Centralize logs in dated files to facilitate debugging and traceability.

4. **Artist Data Management & Page Generation:**
   - Separate artist data management into its own domain (using dedicated tables) and handle updates individually.
   - Consolidate artist page generation functions into `utils.py` to ensure consistent formatting, sanitization, and image handling.
   - Retain existing sanitization and text formatting helpers to preserve consistency.

5. **Centralized Utility Functions:**
   - Move duplicate and related functions (such as those for track lists, release formats, image downloading, and artist page generation) into `utils.py`.
   - Enhance utility functions with proper error handling, logging, and optional parameters (e.g., custom headers for downloads).

6. **Data Safety & Maintenance:**
   - Avoid automated data deletion in migration scripts; perform any destructive operations manually after thorough checks.

7. **General Improvements:**
   - Streamline the integration workflow by separating concerns across modules (utils, db_handler, and the main scraper).
   - Continually review and update helper functions to reduce code duplication and avoid potential bugs.

# Scratchpad

## TODO Tasks
- [X] **Merge duplicate functions:**  
      Remove `format_tracklist()` from `discogs_scraper.py` and update the code to use `format_track_list()` from `utils.py`.
- [X] **Unify release format formatting:**  
      Remove the duplicate `format_release_formats()` from `discogs_scraper.py` and consolidate functionality to use the version from `utils.py`.
- [X] **Centralize image downloading:**  
      Move `download_image()` from `discogs_scraper.py` into `utils.py` (keeping `download_artist_image()` as is) so that both image downloading functions are centralized.
- [X] **Unify artist markdown generation:**  
      Consolidate `create_artist_markdown_file()` in `discogs_scraper.py` and `generate_artist_page()` in `db_handler.py` into one common function (potentially moved to `utils.py`).
- [X] **Consistent progress tracking:**  
      Replaced file-based last processed index tracking with the database-based method in the `processed_index` table.
- [x] **Review sanitization helpers:**  
      Evaluate functions like `escape_quotes()` and `format_notes()` for potential consolidation into `utils.py` to ensure consistent text/sanitization handling across modules.

# Execution Flow Overview

1. **Initialization:**
   - The script starts by parsing command-line arguments and importing all necessary modules.
   - Configuration variables and paths (e.g., DB_PATH, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, ARTIST_DIRECTORY) are defined.

2. **Database Setup:**
   - A DatabaseHandler instance is created.
   - The database is initialized, creating tables for releases, artists, skip list, and the processed_index for progress tracking.

3. **Progress Tracking Initialization:**
   - The last processed index is retrieved from the database using `db_handler.get_last_processed_index()` so that processing can resume where it left off.

4. **Collection Processing Loop:**
   - The script iterates over the collection of releases (displayed via a progress bar).
   - For each release:
        - If the current index is less than the last processed index, the item is skipped.
        - Otherwise, the script processes the release by calling functions (like `process_item()`) which handle API calls (Discogs, Apple Music, Wikipedia, Spotify) and caching.
        - After processing each release, the current index is saved to the database using `db_handler.save_last_processed_index()`.

5. **Artist Data Handling:**
   - During release processing, artist data is verified and, if missing or outdated, is fetched from Discogs.
   - Artist pages are generated using the consolidated function from `utils.py` (via `generate_artist_page()`).

6. **Finalization:**
   - Once all releases are processed, the progress tracking is reset (last processed index is set to 0 in the database).
   - A final summary (including details on missing images and processed artists) is logged and/or printed.

7. **Termination:**
   - The script logs a summary message indicating completion and then exits.
