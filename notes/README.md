## System Understanding

### Current Architecture Strengths
1. **Functional Completeness**: Successfully processes collections end-to-end
2. **Data Resilience**: Database caching with resumable operations
3. **Multi-API Integration**: Rich data from multiple music services
4. **Content Generation**: Hugo-compatible static site output
5. **Manual Override**: Web interface for data curation

### Current Architecture Limitations
1. **Monolithic Design**: Large files handling multiple concerns
2. **Configuration Management**: Scattered settings and hardcoded values
3. **Error Recovery**: Basic retry logic with limited sophistication
4. **Performance Constraints**: Sequential processing limited by API rates
5. **Security Considerations**: Development-grade security implementation

### Critical Refactoring Areas
1. **Service Separation**: Extract API clients into dedicated modules
2. **Configuration Architecture**: Centralized, environment-aware settings
3. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Circuit breakers and retry strategies
4. **Async Processing**: Parallel operations where API limits allow
5. **Observability**: Structured logging and metrics collection

### Processing Characteristics
- **I/O Bound**: Network requests dominate processing time
- **Rate Limited**: External APIs constrain throughput
- **Resumable**: Database-tracked progress enables interruption recovery
- **Enrichment Focused**: Multiple APIs enhance basic Discogs data

### Integration Points
- **Hugo Static Site Generator**: Markdown output with YAML frontmatter
- **SQLite Database**: Single-file persistence with schema management
- **External APIs**: Four distinct services with different auth patterns
- **Image Management**: Local storage with fallback strategies

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
- Extract API clients into service classes
- Implement centralized configuration management
- Add comprehensive unit testing
- Enhance logging with structured format

### Phase 2: Architecture (Medium-term)
- Implement dependency injection patterns
- Add circuit breaker and retry strategies
- Optimize database operations
- Introduce performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Long-term)
- Add async processing capabilities
- Implement comprehensive security
- Scale for multi-user scenarios
- Add advanced observability
